            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <div id="id10">His career is regarded as one of <br>the greatest in history. His rival,<br> Lionel Messi which is also a <br>great player, but for me Cristiano<br> Ronaldo is the greatest. Besides his<br> football master class, he is also a kind man who donates<br> blood for who need it. Even in the covid time, he <br>changed his hotel into a hospital for millions<br> of  dollars, just to cure the disease, which shows he isn’t legend<br> only in the pitch, but even outside of it. <br>We will never truly see a footballer like<br> him even in the future generation. What a player!<br>
